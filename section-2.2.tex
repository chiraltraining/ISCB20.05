\begin{frame}[t]{Measures of Frequency}
	\textbf{Frequency:} Frequency is how often something occurs. \\ 
	\textbf{Example} \\ 
	Twenty students were asked how many hours they worked per day.
	Their responses, in hours,
	are as follows: 5; 6; 3; 3; 2; 4; 7; 5; 2; 3; 5; 6; 5; 4; 4; 3; 5; 2; 
	5; 3
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} 
			\hline 
			Data Values & Frequency \\ 
			\hline 
			2 & 3 \\ 
			\hline 
			3 & 5 \\
			\hline  
			4 & 3 \\
			\hline  
			5 & 6 \\
			\hline  
			6 & 2 \\
			\hline 
			7 & 1 \\
			\hline 
		\end{tabular}

\begin{frame}[t]{Measures of Relative Frequency}
\textbf{Relative Frequency:} How often something happens divided by all 
outcomes.

	\textbf{Example} \\ 
	Twenty students were asked how many hours they worked per day.
	Their responses, in hours,
	are as follows: 5; 6; 3; 3; 2; 4; 7; 5; 2; 3; 5; 6; 5; 4; 4; 3; 5; 2; 
	5; 3
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} 
			\hline 
			Data Values & Frequency & Relative Frequency \\ 
			\hline 
			2 & 3 & $\frac{3}{20}$ or 0.15 \\ 
			\hline 
			3 & 5 &  $\frac{5}{20}$ or 0.25\\
			\hline  
			4 & 3 &  $\frac{3}{20}$ or o.15\\
			\hline  
			5 & 6 &  $\frac{6}{20}$ or 0.30\\
			\hline  
			6 & 2 &  $\frac{2}{20}$ or 0.10 \\
			\hline 
			7 & 1 &  $\frac{1}{20}$ or 0.05\\
			\hline
